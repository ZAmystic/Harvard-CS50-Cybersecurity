# Harvard CS50 Cybersecurity Journey 🚀

This repository serves as a personal archive of my progress through the **Harvard CS50 Cybersecurity** course. While I am unable to afford the official certification at this time, I remain committed to mastering the content and demonstrating my growth through hands-on practice, thorough documentation, and consistent effort.

Each directory and file within this repository reflects:
- 📚 Concepts learned from the course modules
- 🛠️ Practical exercises, projects, and tools explored
- 🧠 Personal insights and applied understanding of cybersecurity principles

My goal is to build a publicly accessible proof-of-learning portfolio that showcases my skills and dedication to the field of cybersecurity. I believe that knowledge should be pursued regardless of financial barriers, and this repository is my way of taking ownership of my learning journey.

Feel free to explore the code, techniques, and notes. If you're on a similar path, you're more than welcome to reach out or collaborate!
